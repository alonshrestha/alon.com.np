One billion plus websites are live and running on the internet. 

Over 576,000 new websites are launched daily according to {{< newtabref  href="https://websitesetup.org/news/how-many-websites-are-there/" title="websitesetup.org" rel="nofollow">}}. But do you know where these websites are or how are they running?

This page has the answers to these questions.

Web hosting means to put up a website online. It is as simple as that.

To make it more clear, I would like to begin this article by defining a website.

## What is a Website?
A website is set of web pages where we can write text, attach files, add media, and create links.

You're currently reading this article on a web page. 

If you scroll to the top, you'll see the title *'@alonshrestha'*. This title is a link, also known as a hyperlink, which connects to another web page.

The collection of these connected web pages are called a website.

Note: *It does not mean a website should have multiple web pages. A website can also have a single web page.*

Every page you visit on the browser is a website.

## What is Web Hosting?
In simpler terms, uploading a website on the internet is web hosting. 

It is similar to uploading a video on YouTube or creating a post on social media.

**But how is a website uploaded on the internet?**

Websites are uploaded on the servers.

A server is a powerful computer that stays connected to the internet constantly. Its major job is to fulfill user requests, such as ours.

Every website you visit is hosted on a server.

**Where can we get these servers?**

The companies that sell such servers are called web hosts or host providers. 

They provide web hosting, email hosting, domain registration, and other different types of internet hosting services.

{{< newtabref  href="https://www.hostinger.com/" title="Hostinger" rel="nofollow">}}, {{< newtabref  href="https://www.bluehost.com/" title="Bluehost" rel="nofollow">}} are some of the well known web hosts you can find on the internet. 

So, web hosting is basically buying a server, putting your website on it, and making it available to everyone.

## How does Web Hosting Work?

The way web hosting works is pretty cool.

The hosting provider sets up a server for you, where you can log in with a username and password.

Once logged in, you can upload your website.

These servers have storage for your website files and an IP address that points to your website.

**How to upload a website on a server?**

There are different methods to upload a website on a server. 

You can simply drag and drop your website files on a server using a browser, select and upload it using an application or transfer it using commands through terminal. 

These methods vary on the web host you choose.

After you upload a website, it's hosted on the server's IP address.

To make it more professional and user-friendly, people use a domain name instead of the IP address.

The domain name essentially masks the IP address of the server.

So whenever you enter the domain name, it takes you to that specific IP address where the website is hosted.

## How to Host a Website?
As mentioned earlier, to host a website, you need a server. 

There are various types of hosting servers available in the market.

For instance, a small startup or a new blog might need a server with fewer resources, while a large e-commerce site with heavy traffic would require a high-spec server.

It's crucial to understand your website's needs before purchasing a server. Otherwise, web hosting can become expensive and frustrating.

Web hosting providers categorize servers into different services, such as:
- **Shared Hosting** : This is for low traffic websites.
- **VPS Hosting** : Perfect for medium traffic websites.
- **Dedicated Hosting** : Business oriented high traffic websites.
- **Cloud Hosting**: Users who want flexibility.

Now, it’s time to pick a web host provider. 

There are numerous  web hosting providers available on the internet. However, not all of them may be reliable. The ones that offer excellent service and support are the ones you can rely on.

If you are clueless about picking the right web host provider, then you can choose any of them mentioned in the list below.
